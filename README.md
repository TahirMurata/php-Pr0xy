## About php-Pr0xy

php-Pr0xy is a simple web proxy written in PHP that can allow you to bypass Internet content filters, or to browse the internet anonymously. php-Pr0xy is completely free but I appreciate donations.

## Installation

### Website
Just enter the website and enter the URL that you want to access. You can also use different types of bypassers such as amazon, sci-hub etc.

### Manual
Simply copy everything in `src` to your web server and access it directly. That's it!

## How to use
  
- Click on a link to copy it to clipboard.

- Press right shift to logout.

- High security to protect the user.

  - Cannot look at what you searched thanks to POST.
	
  - Disguise the `<title>` tag to UwU.
	
  - etc...

php-Pr0xy doesn't require any configuration out of the box, but configuration options are available in the `src/get.php`.

## Known Limitations

php-Pr0xy has several known limitations. Some of them may be fixed in future releases. For now, they include:

* some `<a>` tags are not supported
* No cookie support
